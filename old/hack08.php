         <!-- <h3>Abstract:</h3> -->
         <p>The use of technology has changed the landscape of politics in the
         United States and has fueled one of the most interesting and engaging
         elections in modern memory. The use of creative and targeted online
         fundraising strategies allowed underdog political candidate Barack Obama to
         out-raise the legendary fundraising network of Hillary and Bill Clinton
         and allowed fringe candidate Ron Paul to set fundraising records with a
         primarily Internet based outreach effort. Effective use of social
         networks and blogs has energized and mobilized a historic proportion of
         young and student voters and behind-the-scenes Get out the Vote (GOTV)
         and voter file technology have allowed for the organization and creation of a
         omplicated set of online tools that will drive "the right" people to the
         polls more than ever before.</p>

         <p>This lecture will focus on how technology is being used in the 2008 election
         by considering how each major presidential campaign has used technology to 
         mobilize their supporters and push out their message and what
         this means for American politics going forward. Many examples will be used
         from the current 2008 campaign and previous election cycles - Dean for
         America in 2004 and the DNCC efforts in the 2006 congressional campaigns.
         SpeciÔ¨Åc areas to be considered will be: online fundraising,
         internal campaign technology and voter file integration, digital messaging
         and dissemination, use of social networks, rapid response practices, and
         online journalism and the effect of the blogosphere on the political news
         cycle.</p>

	 <a name="cheney" id="cheney"></a> 
         <p><b>Matt Cheney</b> is a managing partner of a ten person San Francisco based
         consulting company that develops strategy and technology for socially
         motivated clients such as the Kiva (microloans), NASA (space exploration),
         and Partners in Health (health care to the global poor), Silicon Valley savvy
         business types like Sun Microsystems (education tools) and Intel (open source
         communities), and academic institutions like Stanford (online
         publications) and UCSF (library services). In the political arena,
         Cheney worked on half a dozen congressional campaigns, assisted with
         litigation as part of several voting rights
         cases, spent the 2004 election helping coordinate election efforts in
         the Alaskan cold, developed some neat GOTV techniques using social
         networks for the Iowa primaries, and is working on a couple citizen
         engagement tools for the 2008 election. He attended the University of
         Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he received many degrees and did an
         unreasonable number of academic and social projects.</p>

         <!-- <h3>Abstract:</h3> -->
         <p>The statement "You have zero privacy anyway, get over it" was made
         some 6 years ago by one of our more abrasive industry leaders, and
         things have only gotten worse. Advances in technology are enabling
         applications such as location tracking, political profiling and
         classification, and even real time streaming face recognition. Worse,
         most often this data is collected without consent and with no real
         assurance of confidentiality, or even legal or constitutional
         protections.</p>

         <p>We are only just beginning to understand the consequences of having
         our entire lives archived and sold to the highest bidder, to say
         nothing of rampant government surveillance. Those who are not careful
         with protecting their personal information and online activities are
         in for some unpleasant surprises in the future: be it from a bitter
         divorce case, character attacks in a frivolous lawsuit, political
         opposition, or just plain old marketing spam that arrives at exactly
         the wrong time.</p>

         <p>By day <b>Michael Perry</b> is a mild mannered reverse engineer
         owned and operated by Riverbed Technology, slaving away at accelerating 
         broken monopolistic protocols from the Evil Empire and generally helping to
         make the intranets faster by several orders of magnitude. By night, he
         transforms into an ardent supporter of digital rights, privacy, and
         anonymity on and offline. Mike believes that not only is it every
         person's right to opt-out of the Database Nation, it is also in their
         self-interest to do so, and to have company. In a world where our
         minute-to-minute thoughts are archived by IP address in search
         engines, Mike believes Tor is desperately needed not just by political
         dissidents, but by everyone.</p>
