The first step to figuring out what is going on 
      in our target program is to gather as much information as we can. Several 
      tools allow us to do this on both platforms. Let's take a look at them.
     </p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="info_process_information"></a>System Wide Process Information</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
	  On Microsoft Windows© as on Linux, several applications will give you varying
	  amounts of information about processes running. However, there is a one
	  stop shop for information on both systems.
	  </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2547667"></a>/proc</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
        The Linux /proc filesystem contains all sorts of interesting information,
        from where libraries and other sections of the code are mapped, to which
        files and sockets are open where.  The /proc filesystem contains
        a directory for each currently running process.  So, if you started a
        process whose pid was 1337, you could enter the directory /proc/1337/ to find
        out almost anything about this currently running process.  You can
        only view process information for processes which you own.
        </p><p>
        The files in this directory change with each UNIX OS.  The interesting 
		ones in Linux are:
        cmdline -- lists the command line parameters passed to the process
        cwd -- a link to the current working directory of the process
        environ -- a list of the environment variables for the process
        exe -- the link to the process executable
        fd -- a list of the file descriptors being used by the process
        maps -- VERY USEFUL.  Lists the memory locations in use by this
        process.  These can be viewed directly with gdb to find out various
        useful things.
        </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2456554"></a>Sysinternals Process Explorer</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
	   <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com" target="_top">Sysinternals</a>
		provides an all-around must-have set of utilities. In this case,
		Process Explorer is the functional equivalent of /proc. It can show
		you dll mapping information, right down to which functions are at
		which addresses, as well as process properties, which includes an
		environment tab, security attributes, what files and objects are open, what
		the type of objects those handles are for, etc. It will also allow you
		to modify processes for which you have access to in ways that are not
		possible in /proc. You can close handles, change permissions, open
		debug windows, and change process priority.

      The first step towards understanding how a program works is to 
      analyze what libraries it is linked against. This can help us
      immediately make predictions as to the type of program we're dealing
      with and make some insights into its behavior.
      </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2565776"></a>ldd</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
        ldd is a basic utility that shows us what libraries a program is linked
        against, or if its statically linked. It also gives us the addresses 
        that these libraries are mapped into the program's execution space, 
        which can be handy for following function calls in disassembled output 
        (which we will get to shortly).
       </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2547185"></a>depends</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
       depends is a utility that comes with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/setuplauncher.htm" target="_top">Microsoft©
       SDK</a>, as well as with MS Visual Studio. It will show you quite a
       bit about the linking information for a program. Not only will list
       dll's, but it will list which functions in those DLL's are being
       imported (used) by the current executable, and how they are imported,
       and then do this recursively for all dll's linked against the
       executable.
       
        </p><div class="figure"><a name="id2519765"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 3.2. Depends</b></p><div class="screenshot"><div><img src="images/depends.png" alt="Depends"></div></div></div><p>
       </p><p>
       The layout is a little bit much to process at first. When you click on
       a DLL, you get the functions from this DLL imported by its parent in 
       the tree (upper right, in green). You also get a list of all the 
       functions that this DLL exports. Those that also present in the imports
       pane are light blue with a dark blue dot. Those that are called 
       somewhere in the entire linked maze are blue, and those that aren't
       used at all are grey. Most often all that is used to determine the
       location of the function is a string and/or an ordinal number, which
       specifies the numeric index of this function in the export table.
       Sometimes, the function will be "bound", which means that the linker
       took a guess at it's location in memory and filled it in. Note that
       bindings may be rejected as "stale", however, so modifiying this value 
       in the executable won't always give you the results you suspect. We
       will discuss this more in the <a href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Code Modification">code modification and
       interception</a> sections.       
       </p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="info_function_information"></a>Obtaining Function Information</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>
      The next step in reverse engineering is the ability to differentiate
      functional blocks in programs. Unfortunately, this can prove to be quite
      difficult if you aren't lucky enough to have debug information enabled.
      We'll discuss some of those techniques later.
      </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2519826"></a>nm</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
        nm lists all of the local and library functions, global variables, and
        their addresses in the binary. However, it will not work on binaries 
        that have been stripped with strip.
       </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2519839"></a>dumpbin.exe</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>Unfortunately, the closest thing Microsoft Windows© has to nm is dumpbin.exe,
	  which isn't very great. The only thing it can do is essentially what
	  depends already does: that is list functions used by this binary
	  (dumpbin /imports), and list functions provided by this binary (dumpbin /exports). 
	  The only way a binary can export a function (and thus the only way the
	  function is visible) is if that function has the __declspec( dllexport ) 
	  tag next to it's prototype (FIXME: Verify).
	  </p><p>
	   Luckily, depends is so overkill, it often provides us with more than
	   the information we need to get the job done.  Furthermore, the cygwin
       port of objdump also gets the job done a lot of the time. We discuss
       objdump in <a href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Determining Interesting Functions">Chapter 5.</a>

        lsof is a program that lists all open files by the processes running
    on a system. An open file may be a regular file, a directory, a    block
    special file, a character special file, an executing text reference, 
    a library, a stream or a network file (Internet socket, NFS file or 
    UNIX domain socket). It has plenty of options, but in its default mode
    it gives an extensive listing of the opened files. lsof does not come
    installed by default with most of the flavors of Linux/UNIX, so you
    may need to install it by yourself. On some distributions lsof
    installs in /usr/sbin which by default is not in your path and you
    will have to add it.
    An example output would be: </p><pre class="screen">

    netstat is handy little tool that is present on all modern operating
    systems. It is used to display network connections, routing tables,
    interface statistics, and more.
       </p><p>
        How can netstat be useful? Let's say we are trying to reverse engineer
    a program that uses some network communication. A quick look at what
    netstat displays can give us clues where the program connects and
    after some investigation maybe why it connects to this host.
    netstat does not only show TCP/IP connections, but also UNIX domain
    socket connections which are used in interprocess communication in
    lots of programs.
    Here is an example output of it:
    </p><div class="figure"><a name="id2538689"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 3.3. Netstat output</b></p><pre class="screen">

        As you can see there is great deal of info shown by netstat. But what
    is the meaning of it?
    The output is divided in two parts - Internet connections and UNIX
    domain sockets as mentioned above. Here is breifly what the Internet
    portion of netstat output means. The first column shows the protocol
    being used (tcp, udp, unix) in the particular connection. Receiving
    and sending queues for it are displayed in the next two columns,
    followed by the information identifying the connection - source host
    and port, destination host and port. The last column of the output
    shows the state of the connection. Since there are several stages in
    opening and closing TCP connections, this field was included to show
    if the connection is ESTABLISHED or in some of the other available
    states. SYN_SENT, TIME_WAIT, LISTEN are the most often seen ones. To
    see complete list of the available states look in the man page for
    netstat. FIXME: Describe these states.
       </p><p>
        Depending on the options being passed to netstat, it is possible to
    display more info. In particular interesting for us is the -p option
    (not available on all UNIX systems). This will show us the program
    that uses the connection shown, which may help us determine the
    behaviour of our target.
    Another use of this options is in tracking down spyware programs that
    may be installed on your system. Showing all the network connection
    and looking for unknown entries is invaluable tool in discovering
    programs that you are unaware of that send information to the network.
    This can be combined with the -a option to show all connections. By
    default listening sockets are not displayed in netstat. Using the -a
    we force all to be shown. -n shows numerical IP addesses instead of
    hostnames.

    So this output shows that mozilla has established a connection with
    winston for HTTP traffic (since port is www(80)). In the
    second output we see that the SMB daemon, X server, and ssh daemon
    listen for incoming connections.

	 Collecting network data is usually done with a program called sniffer.
	 What the program does is to put your ethernet card into promiscuous mode
	 and gather all the information that it sees. What is a promiscuous mode?
	 Ethernet is a broadcast media. All computers broadcast their messages on
	 the wire and anyone can see those messages. Each network interface card
	 (NIC), as a hardcoded physical address called MAC (Media Access Control)
	 address, which is used in the Ethernet protocol. When sending data over
	 the wire, the OS specifies the destination of the data and only the NIC
	 with the destination MAC address will actually process the data. All
	 other NICs will disregard the data coming on the wire. When in
	 promiscuous mode, the card picks up all the data that it sees and sends
	 it to the OS. In this case you can see all the data that is flowing on
	 your local network segment.

	 Switched networks eliminate the broadcast to all machines, but sniffing
	 traffic is still possible using certain techniques like ARP poisoning.
	 (FIXME: link with section on ARP poisoning if we have one.)
	 </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
	 Several popular sniffing programs exist, which differ in user interface
	 and capabilities, but any one of them will do the job. Here are some good
	 tools that we use on a daily basis:
	 </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
	 <a href="http://www.ethereal.com/" target="_top">ethereal</a> - 
	 one of the best sniffers out there. It has a
	 graphical interface built with the GTK library. It is not
	 just a sniffer, but also a protocol analyzer. It breaks down the
	 captured data into pieces, showing the meaning of each piece (for example
	 TCP flags like SYN or ACK, or even kerberos or NTLM headers). Furthermore,
	 it has excellent packet filtering mechanisms, and can save captures of
	 network traffic that match a filter for later analysis. It is 
	 available for both Microsoft Windows© and Linux and requires (as almost any sniffer) 
	 the pcap library. Ethereal is available at <a href="http://www.ethereal.com" target="_top">www.ethereal.com</a> and you will need
	 <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/" target="_top">libpcap</a> for Linux or <a href="http://winpcap.polito.it/" target="_top">WinPcap</a> for Microsoft Windows©.
	   </p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.tcpdump.com/" target="_top">tcpdump</a> -
	 one of the first sniffing programs. It is a
	 console application that prints info to the screen. The advantage is that
	 it comes by default with most Linux distributions. Microsoft Windows© version is
	 available as well, called <a href="http://winpcap.polito.it/" target="_top">WinDump</a>. 
	   </p></li><li><p><a href="http://ettercap.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">ettercap</a> - 
	 also a console based sniffer. Uses the ncurses
	 library to provide console GUI. It has built in ARP poisoning capability
	 and supports plugins, which give you the power to modify data on the fly.
	 This makes it very suitable for all kinds of Man-In-The-Middle attacks
	 (MITM), which will we will describe in chapter (FIXME: link). Ettercap
	 isn't that great a sniffer, but nothing prevents you from using its ARP
	 poisoning and plugin features while also running a more powerful sniffer
	 such as ethereal.
	   </p></li></ul></div><p>
     </p><p>
	 Now that you know what a sniffer is and hopefully learned how to use
	 basic functionality of your favorite one, you are all set to gather
	 network data. Let's say you want to know how does a mail client
	 authenticate and fetch messages from the server. Since the protocol in
	 use is POP3, we should instruct ethereal (our sniffer of choice) to
	 capture traffic only destined to port 110 or originating from port 110.
   In our case since we want to capture both directions of the traffic we
   can set the filter to be <span><b class="command">tcp.port == 110</b></span>.
	 If you have a lot of machines checking mail at the same time on a network
	 with a hub, you might want to restrict the matching only to your machine
	 and the server you are connecting to. Here is an example of captured
	 packet in ethereal:

	 
    </p><div class="figure"><a name="id2550444"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 3.4. Ethereal capture</b></p><div class="screenshot"><div><img src="images/ethereal-pop3-capture.png" alt="Ethereal capture"></div></div></div><p>
	 Ethereal breaks down the packet for us, showing what each part of the
   data means. For example, it shows that the Internet Protocol version is 4
   or that the header checksum is 0x74bb and is in fact the correct checksum
   for that packet. It shows in similar manner details for each part of the
   header and the data at the end of the packet if any.
  </p><p>
	 Using packet captures, one can trace the flow of a protocol to better
	 understand how an application works, or even try to reverse engineer the
	 protocol itself if unknown.
