    low level, and thus produce an executable file that very closely matches
    what we want. But the question is, how is our program code now actually
    stored on disk?</p><p>
    We'll begin our investigation into executable formats by looking at the 
    <a href="http://www.skyfree.org/linux/references/ELF_Format.pdf" target="_top">
     ELF binary specification</a> and related tools, and then move on to
     examine the <a href="http://www.corbina.ru/~oberon/PECOFF.pdf" target="_top">PE binary
     specification</a>, and related tools for dealing with those binaries.

    function,
    and move on from there to __libc_start_main, and eventually to main, which
    is our code. So somehow the operating system is gathering together a whole
    lot of code from various places, and loading it into memory and then
    running it. How does it know what code goes where?</p><p>The answer on Linux and UNIX is the <a href="http://www.skyfree.org/linux/references/ELF_Format.pdf" target="_top">
     ELF binary specification.</a> ELF specifies a standard format for
     mapping your code on disk to a complete executable image in
     memory that consists of your code, a stack, a heap (for malloc), and all
     the libraries you link against.</p><p>So lets provide an overview of the information needed for our purposes
     here, and refer the user to the ELF spec to fill in the details if they
     wish. We'll start from the beginning of a typical executable and work our
     way down.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="elf_layout"></a>ELF Layout</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>There are three header areas in an ELF file: The main ELF file header,
     the program headers, and then the section headers. The program code lies
     in between the program headers and the section headers.</p><p>TODO: Insert figure here to show a typical ELF layout.</p><p>NOTE: ELF is extremely flexible. Many of these sections can be shunk,
     expanded, removed, etc. In fact, it is not outside the realm of
     possibility that some programs may deliberately make abnormal, yet valid

     FIXME: Describe what ELF looks like in memory on Linux (and maybe xBSD
     and Solaris). Include memory addresses and diagrams of the process space.

  Unfortunately, the PE format can be a bit of a maze, so we're only going to
  discuss those sections relevant to code modification, namely the Import
  Address Table and code sections. FIXME: what is the equiv of _start for 
  Microsoft Windows©.
  FIXME: How does COM use its directory entry?
  </p><p>
  So lets start with some basic concepts. There are essentially four ways to
  refer to a location in a PE image (and all are used by the various data
  structures in some form or another).
  </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Executable File Offset</p><p>
      This is simply the offset from the beginning of the executable file.
      </p></li><li><p>Relative Virtual Address (RVA)</p><p>
      This is the offset from the base address of the executable image 
      once it has been mapped into memory. Note that this is 
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not the same</em></span> as the executable file offset.
      Various sections within the executable file have to start on page
      aligned boundaries, and as a result, holes must be present in memory
      that are not present in the disk image. This is a big source of
      confusion when initially working with PE's.
      </p></li><li><p>Section Offset</p><p>
      This is the offset from whatever data structure or section you are
      currently in. Yes, in some cases it is used in lieu of the RVA.
      (FIXME: Build a semi-complete list of these).
      </p></li><li><p>Virtual Address</p><p>
      This is a full pointer into the address space of the process.
      Virtual addresses can be obtained by the formula </p><div class="equation">VA = RVA + base
      address</div><p>. For almost all executables, the base address is 0x400000. For
      DLL's, the base address can vary, as the address requested by the DLL
      in its header is much more likely to conflict with another DLL. The accompanying source code (FIXME: Clean up and Link in) for function injection contains a function that converts RVA's to VA's or file offsets, depending upon the context.
      </p></li></ol></div><p>
  </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2575748"></a>PE Headers</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
   So there are three main header types to a PE file. It's going to be a lot to keep track of. Luckily, the <a href="http://www.magma.ca/~wjr/PEview.zip" target="_top">PEView utility</a> can make things much more easy to understand. We suggest using it on an executable and following along so you don't get lost. These headers and the supporting macros are all defined in WinNT.h in the PlatformSDK include directory.

   The IMAGE_DOS_HEADER is a relic from the (you guess it) DOS days. It's only function now the e_lfanew field, which gives the offset to the of the IMAGE_NT_HEADERS structure, which is where the real action starts. Technically this is a file offset, but at this point, allignment isn't an issue, and it can be intrepreted as an RVA as well. One other thing to note: e_magic has the value IMAGE_DOS_HEADER, which is "MZ" or 0x5A4D.

    Not really much of interest at this level. That Signature field is just to make sure you're in the right place, and has the value IMAGE_NT_SIGNATURE, which is PE00, or 0x00004550. If we open up that IMAGE_FILE_HEADER:

    This essentially is only useful (for our purposes) for knowing the

    So the interesting fields here are ImageBase, AddressOfEntryPoint, 
    SectionAlignment, and the CheckSum (FIXME: do they ever use this?).
    After that comes the DataDirectory, which contains basicaly the root of an 
    entire filesystem heirarchy within the executable. Luckily most executables 
    only use the top level of this filesystem.

    So the array of these is what makes up the end of the optional header. Don't be fooled by that name, it is in fact a relative virtual address. Lets have a look at the data structure for the second array index (ie index 1). Going to this RVA will take us to the import directory, which is an array of DLL's that this PE file is linked against.

   So these fields can be a bit confusing, mostly because at this point, the PE
   format itself gets a bit confusing. First off, the OriginalFirstThunk is an
   RVA, as is Name and FirstThunk. So this is important. Name isn't a pointer to
   an ASCII string, but an RVA to one, which you must convert. The last import
   descriptor in the file will have zeroes for all of its fields and it serves 
   as an end marker.
   </p><p>
   As the comments indicate, there are in fact two import tables for each DLL.
   When non-zero, OriginalFirstThunk refers to the "Unbound" Import Table. 
   FirstThunk, on the other hand, refers to the Import Address Table.

   In many executables files, both of these tables look exactly the same.  The
reason for this is that the IAT is rewritten when the executable is loaded into
memory, and at that point contains the actual addresses of imported functions
(hence the Function member of the union). It then servers a purpose similar to
the PLT we saw in the ELF format. As the name OriginalThunk suggests, the
"Unbound" Import Table remains unchanged, to preserve function name and ordinal
information (to what end, no one seems to really know. FIXME: Maybe LoadLibrary
uses this to remap functions if DLL's need to be shuffled around?). In some
executables, the IAT can come pre-bound, and filled in with expected addresses
already as an efficiency mechanism. 
   </p><p>

But, the complexities don't end there. An imported function can be listed by
name, or it can be listed by an ordinal number which represents its position in
the DLL's export table. If it is listed by an ordinal number, high bit
(1&lt;&lt;31, or 0x80000000) of this union is set. If it is not set, then it is
either an RVA to a forwarder string, a function address (which is a Virtual
Address), or an RVA to a structure that contains the function name (FIXME: How
are these three differentiated?)

    Luckly, most
    if it isn't directly relevant. Our ticket to paradise is that Function 
    member field of the Import Address Table. Modifying him will allow us to
    drop in any old arbitrary function we want, as we will cover in the <a href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Code Modification">Code modification Chapter</a>. Things you might want to cover
    if you're curious are the export tables and the COM data directory.
    (FIXME: Consider documenting COM tables).
