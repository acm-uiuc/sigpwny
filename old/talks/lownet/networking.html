<h3>Whirlwind overview of the sockets API</h3>

<p>"Everything's a file," sayeth the UNIX guru's. But what about networking?
How can that possibly be a file? Well, it's not a file in the sense that it
exists on the filesystem (though some information about network connections
can be found in /proc), but it IS a file in the sense that once a network
connection is set up, it behaves like any other file descriptor (a low integer
index into a kernel table) and can be used with read(2) and write(2), and more
usefully, fdopen(3) (or <a
href="http://www.ictp.trieste.it/~manuals/programming/sun/c-plusplus/c++_lrm/Iostream.doc.html#627">iostream::attach()</a>).

<p>This design also allows network connection handling to be abstracted away,
and programs can be executed with a network connection for standard out,
standard in, and standard error file descriptors (0, 1, and 2). This is how
(x)inetd works.

<p>This is unfortunately NOT the case in windows. Windows Sockets provided by
the winsock.dll are NOT file descriptors. They are NOT compatible with fdopen
and stdio for god knows what reason. Oh well, we all knew that OS sucked to
program on anyways.

<p>Regular sockets programming is described quite elegantly in <a href="http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~beej/guide/net/html">Beej's network
programming guide</a>.

<p><li><a href="evilnet/listen.c">Example of listen</a>

<p>Raw sockets work a bit differently, and vary slightly from UNIX platform to
UNIX platform. Information on how Linux does things can be found in packet(7),
and basically involves a call to socket as well as a call to setsockopt every
time you want to change your hwaddr. This sucks and is slow.. The old school
way was that you could write your hwaddr right into the packet without the
extra system call overhead.

<p><a href="http://www.packetfactory.net/Projects/Libnet/">libnet</a> and 
<a href="http://www.tcpdump.org">libpcap</a> abstract all of this away for us, and are portable.

<h3>Ethernet packet format</h3>

<p>Anyways, so lets talk about the format 

<p>Ethernet data is actually very simple to work with. It comes in pretty much
fixed frames across the wire according to the following structure:

<pre>
<code>
struct/class ethernetFrame
{
	u_char preamble[8]; // Used to sync the clocks of two cards
	u_char dst[6]; // destination hwaddr
	u_char src[6]; // src hwaddr
	u_char frame_type[2]; // frametype. One of ETHERTYPE_ARP, ETHERTYPE_IP, etc
	u_char data[1500]; // min 64
	u_char crc[4]; // checksum
};
</code>
</pre>

<p>However, when operating in raw mode with libpcap/libnet, the structure
appears as follows:

<pre>
<code>
struct/class ethernetFrame
{
	u_char dst[6]; // destination hwaddr
	u_char src[6]; // src hwaddr
	short frame_type // frametype. One of ETHERTYPE_ARP, ETHERTYPE_IP, etc
	u_char data[1500]; // min 64
};
</code>
</pre>

<p>Switches use the source address and the dest address to direct packets to
the appropriate port. They can either be pre-programmed with lists of which
address is on each port, or they can automaticall add hw addresses to a port
when they see a packet with a particular source address. (Usually this entails
removing that address from another port if it exists, which can be quite
amusing at times ;)

<h3>ARP packet format</h3>

<p>So if ethernet frame's have source and dest addresses, how do you translate
between the two?

<p>The answer is the Address Resolution Protocol. When a host wants to know an
IP, it sends a packet to the broadcast ethernet address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)
asking what ethernet address a particular IP is on. It is then that host's job
to respond in a timely fashion, and then all traffic for that IP is then sent
to a the responded dest address.

<p>Packet format:

<pre>
<code>
/* 
 *  ARP packet header prototype.  Too many O/S's define this differently.
 *  Easy enough to solve that and define it here.
 */
struct libnet_arp_hdr
{
    u_short ar_hrd;                         /* format of hardware address */
#define ARPHRD_ETHER     1                  /* ethernet hardware format */
    u_short ar_pro;                         /* format of protocol address */
    u_char  ar_hln;                         /* length of hardware address */
    u_char  ar_pln;                         /* length of protocol addres */
    u_short ar_op;                          /* operation type */
#define ARPOP_REQUEST    1                  /* req to resolve address */
#define ARPOP_REPLY      2                  /* resp to previous request */
#define ARPOP_REVREQUEST 3                  /* req protocol address given hardw$
#define ARPOP_REVREPLY   4                  /* resp giving protocol address */
#define ARPOP_INVREQUEST 8                  /* req to identify peer */
#define ARPOP_INVREPLY   9                  /* resp identifying peer */

    /*
     *  These should implementation defined but I've hardcoded eth/IP.
     */
    u_char ar_sha[6];                         /* sender hardware address */
    u_char ar_spa[4];                         /* sender protocol address */
    u_char ar_tha[6];                         /* target hardware address */
    u_char ar_tpa[4];                         /* target protocol address */
};

<h3>EtterCap Plugins</h3>

<p>Ettercap plugins are easy, yet very very powerful. Check the README.PLUGINS
in the source directory, and the H99_dummy plugin for documentation and
examples. Packet headers are defined in src/include/ec_inet_structures.h.
Basically all you need to do is cast your pointer to the appropriate data
structure. Use the source, luke.
