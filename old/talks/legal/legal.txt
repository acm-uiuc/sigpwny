Announcing the first annual SIGMil legal rights talk!

- April 15th at 7 PM in 2405 Siebel Center -

This Friday, SIGMil will be presenting a talk about your legal rights (or
the surprising lack thereof).  We expect this talk to be a little more fun
and useful than the usual safe presentation of such material.

Did you know....
     - Police are fully within their rights to lie to you during
     questioning, even about vital evidence such as the confessions
     of co-conspirators,evidence found at the crime scene and lab
     results.

     - In Illinois, you are required to identify yourself to a
     police officer if you are stopped on the street, even with no
     probable cause.

     - The Miranda warning has only existed for 39 years, has little
     basis in the constitution, and may be eliminated in the near
     future.

     - A valet parking your car can give police permission to search
     your car.



The topics covered will include but certainly not be limited to:
    Introduction to the legal system.
    How to find out what the law is without paying lots of cash.
    General advice for interaction with police officers.
    What exactly is probable cause anyways?
    What is required for a warrant?
    When can arrests/searches occur without a warrant?
    What are your rights upon arrest?
    When can you be stopped and searched without probable cause?
    What does it mean to consent to a search?
    How do anonymous tipsters work?
    What third parties can give consent to search your home/office/vehicle?
    What are the requirements for wiretapping/digital surveillance?
    What are the restrictions on police interrogation?
    What has changed since September 11th?
    And any other topics that may come up during discussion.
