<H3>HTTP: GET and POST</H3>
<P>These are two different methods in which HTTP data is passed to
scripts<BR>Forms submit information to scripts.</P>
<UL>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>GET</B> - Form data is encoded
in URL.</P>
<LI><P><B>POST</B> - Form data is encoded in message body.</P>
</UL>
<P>This is fairly basic knowledge but it is important to understand
how scripts can be exploited. Often it is important to try as many
different input combinations as possible to discover <SPAN LANG="en-US">vulnerabilities.</SPAN>
</P>
<H3>Server and Client Side Scripting</H3>
<UL>
<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Server Side Scripting</B> -
Scripts are processes server side. All execution is the
<SPAN LANG="en-US">responsibility</SPAN> of the server. The results
are sent to the client. In most cases it is impossible to view the
actual code that produced the output unless certain exploitation
methods are used.<BR><B>Examples:</B> ASP, JSP, PHP and Coldfusion 
</P>
<LI><P><B>Client Side Scripting</B> - Scripts are processed on the
client side. The browser is responsible for parsing data and
producing output. It is easy to <SPAN LANG="en-US">determine</SPAN>
how the script operates and what output will be produced by just
viewing the source of the page. <BR><B>Examples:</B> Javascript,
	VBScript 
	</P>
	</UL>
	<P><BR>To exploit either one of these types of web pages it is just a
	matter of finding a suitable input that causes the script to behave
	in ways that are unexpected. This sounds easier than it actually is,
	but often analyzing code can lead to an exploit. Most of the time,
	exploits are a result of the web programmers inability to have
	foresight about the input that the application will receive. On the
	<SPAN LANG="en-US">other hand</SPAN>, some exploits are inherent the
	the browser software itself (IE mostly) and simple exploits can be
	crafted to hurt the client (instead of the normal case of hacking the
			server). 
	</P>
	<H3>Making the Cookie Kingdom Crumble</H3>
	<P>Cookies are everywhere. They serve as an authentication <SPAN LANG="en-US">byproduct</SPAN>
	for many websites. Often, a website will offer a cookie to a user
	after they have entered their password. This often serves as a <SPAN LANG="en-US">matter</SPAN>
	of <SPAN LANG="en-US">convenience</SPAN>, but it many cases
	(depending on the type of cookie) can present a serious security
	risk. <BR><BR>For instance, imagine the situation in which you log
	into your favorite bulletin board system. It is your favorite of
	course because you are the <SPAN LANG="en-US">administrator</SPAN>
	and you love the power trip. So you type in your password, you check
	the box on your BBS that says &quot; remember me&quot;. You do your
	normal purging of bad threads, then call it a night. The next day you
	go back to the BBS and it asks you to <SPAN LANG="en-US">re
	authenticate.</SPAN> Weird, you think to yourself, you typed in your
	password last night. Before you know it, you look at the publicly
	viewable pages and everything has changed, your system was
	hacked!<BR><BR><B>What Happened?</B> This is a true story.
	<SPAN LANG="en-US">Fortunately</SPAN>, I was on the hacker end and
	not the administrator. I discovered a bug inherent in ANY web
	applications that use cookies for session to session based
	validation. Basically, the problem with this particular BBS software
	was that because a user was logged in, they were not forced to type
	their password again when they went to preferences. As a result of
	that the new password has to be entered twice, without entering the
	old password. <B>At this point, some alarm bells should be going off
	in your head</B> The simplest way to do this was make a thread on the
	forum that contained some very basic HTML. The following HTML is a
	basic template of how the original code
	worked.<BR><BR>http://www.somesite.com/cgi/ubb/pref?user=admin?pass=0wn3dpass2=0wn3d<BR><BR>Oh,
	this code might work, but no one in their right mind would click a
	link like this!<BR>Right? Wrong!<BR><BR>Try this &lt;img
	src=&quot;http://www.somesite.com/cgi/ubb/pref?user=admin?pass=0wn3dpass2=0wn3d&quot;
	border =&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;0&quot;&amp;rt;<BR><BR>Now
	when any user views this page it will try to change their password.
	It will only work for the user specified, which in this case is
	really all that matters.<BR>This same tactic was used by me to
	exploit thefacebook.com. While it was not the same type of cookie(it
			was a session cookie) the password changing tactic was still the
	same...it worked like a <SPAN LANG="en-US">charm. If</SPAN> HTML is
	not enabled, one can send a malicious link to the target, but it
	would be wise to encode the data in the link before sending (HEX is
			the most basic). 
	</P>
	<H3>SQL Injection</H3>
	<P>This method is just an extension of fuzzing server and client side
	scripting methods. The idea is simple, imagine a request that is
	just:<BR>&quot;SELECT address FROM USERNAMES WHERE name =
	USERINPUTHERE&quot;<BR>From this point imagine this is some sort of
	script that grabs a users address based on the <SPAN LANG="en-US">user
	name.</SPAN> Well in the case of bad input design, imagine all this
	information is stored in one database. It requires minor modification
	to completely own the database.<BR>USERINPUTHERE = shanna&quot;&quot;;SELECT
	* FROM USERNAMES&quot;;<BR>&quot;SELECT password FROM USERNAMES WHERE
	name = *&quot;;&quot;SELECT * FROM USERNAMES&quot;;<BR><BR><BR>From
	this lines two queries are executed. One dumps the address of the
	<SPAN LANG="en-US">user name</SPAN> specified, the other dumps all
	the records in the USERNAME table. Including password, address, and
	whatever <SPAN LANG="en-US">sensitive</SPAN> information is stored in
	the database.<BR><BR>Although this is a greatly simplified example,
	the concepts when applied to larger and more complex databases are
	still the same. Including, deleting users, adding users, changing
	password, and modifying the database structure. 
	</P>
	<H3>Cross Site Scripting</H3>
	<P>Cross site scripting is a very general term. In it's most basic
	sense it means forcibly inserting html or script into another <SPAN LANG="en-US">web
	page.</SPAN> When inserted the code runs on what looks like the &quot;real
	<SPAN LANG="en-US">web server</SPAN>&quot; and can do all kinds of
	<SPAN LANG="en-US">nasty</SPAN> things. <BR><BR>The general <SPAN LANG="en-US">strategy</SPAN>
	as is follows, 
	</P>
	<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Look for a script that displays
	user supplied data in the <SPAN LANG="en-US">web page.</SPAN> 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Inject a form, or other malicious
	script to preform the desired task. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Profit. 
	</P>
	</UL>
	<P><BR>The simplest example can be found in a site that has some
	useless form like:<BR>Please enter your name: HEYHEY<BR>On the next
	page: <B>WELCOME, HEYHEY</B><BR><BR>Wow, really useless. This is an
	over simplified <SPAN LANG="en-US">piece</SPAN> of garbage, and any
	site that might employ such web tactics really isn't worth hacking at
	all. The principle is the same though. From this point we could just
	inject form data into the <SPAN LANG="en-US">web page</SPAN> asking
	for a user to <SPAN LANG="en-US">re authenticate.</SPAN> Yeah, this
	example isn't very clear, but let's take a look at the example used
	at thefacebook.com. <BR><A HREF="http://www.vividmachines.com/fcss.html">thefacebook
	CSS</A>. 
	</P>
	<H3>ActiveX and other Tricks that Only Work on Idiots</H3>
	<P>ActiveX, the most <SPAN LANG="en-US">wondrous</SPAN> technology
	ever invented. While this may or may not be true it surely is a fun
	way to destroy a client's computer. I'm not going to get into extreme
	detail about <SPAN LANG="en-US">what</SPAN> exactly goes on under the
	hood here, but basically you create an ActiveX control. This is
	simply a binary that has some COM interfaces that can be used just
	about anywhere (programs, <SPAN LANG="en-US">web pages</SPAN>, etc.).
	The basic idea is, create a <SPAN LANG="en-US">web page</SPAN> that
	steals a password, deletes a partition, gives you a million dollars,
	etc., then <SPAN LANG="en-US">embed</SPAN> it in a <SPAN LANG="en-US">web
	page.</SPAN> Send the victim to the <SPAN LANG="en-US">web page</SPAN>
	with the reassurance that if the ActiveX control is run, everything
	will be safe. Hilarity ensues. This is basically the <SPAN LANG="en-US">equivalent</SPAN>
	of sending someone an email that says DOWNLOAD THIS DOCUMENT.doc
	.scr. It will only work on your <SPAN LANG="en-US">grandma</SPAN>, I
	assure you.
