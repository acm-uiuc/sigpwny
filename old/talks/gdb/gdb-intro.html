<h1><center>The GNU Debugger</center></h1>


<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Compiling for debugging</h3>

<p>To compile a program for debugging, you must pass gcc the '-g' switch. You
can use '-g' with '-O'. However, if you use -O3 or higher, or manually
specifiy -fomit-frame-pointer, you will not be able to reliably view call
traces.

<p>If you do not use '-g', you will not be able to view source while you
debug, but in some cases you still will be able to set breakpoints at the
function level. In all cases you should be able to set breakpoints at library
calls.

<h3>Running The Program</h3>

<p>To start gdb with the program, you simply say '<i>gdb exename</i>'.

<p>Once gdb starts, if the program you are debugging has debugging
information, gdb will just display it's normal banner. However if there are no
debugging symbols, gdb will say '(no debugging symbols found)'

<p>Once you get a prompt, you can start your program by saying 'run'.
If you want to pass any arguments, say 'run args'. Once you provide args to
'run', gdb will remember them for the rest of the session, and subsequence
run commands do not need to specify args.

<p>If you need to add any environment variables to the program, you can say 
'set env VAR=value'. This is useful for debuging things like SOCKS, or for
using malloc debuggers, etc.

<h2>Execution Stack and Current Location</h2>

<p>Ok, so now say our program has stopped, either due to a breakpoint (covered
next), hitting control-c, or maybe a crash. How do we tell where it crashed
at? 

<p>The '<i>backtrace</i>' command, often simply '<i>bt</i>', will show us the
current execution stack. <i>up</i> and <i>down</i> move you up and down the
execution stack, respectively.

<p>Also, the <i>list</i> command will show us a brief source listing around
the location of the crash. Successive invocations of <i>list</i> will cause 
5 more lines to be shown after the current location. <i>list n</i> will show
us 10 lines centered around line <i>n</i>.

<h2>Setting Breakpoints and Watchpoints</h2>

<p>By far the most useful feature of gdb is not the ability to halt
immediately at a crash, but to set a break point at some time in program
execution before the crash ocurrs. You do this with the <i>break</i> command,
which takes as an argument either a function, a line number, or a file:line.


<p>Watchpoints are also useful, since they can alert you to whenever a
variable changes value. You can set write watchpoints with '<i>watch</i>',
read watchpoints with '<i>rwatch</i>' and both watchpoints with
'<i>awatch</i>'. Note that these watchpoints only keep track of a single 32
bit value. You cannot watch memory ranges, unfortunately, unless you specify
each section of the range 4 bytes at a time.

 FIXME: write macro do do this.

-->

<!-- <p>Catchpoints are useful for C++.  FIXME -->

<p>You can list all your current watchpoints, breakpoints and catchpoints 
with <i>info watchpoints</i>, and you can delete a particular point with
<i>delete n</i>.

<p>The <i>continue</i> or <i>cont</i> command will cause execution to resume
after a breakpoint or watchpoint, and the <i>next</i> and <i>step</i> commands
will cause you to go to the next line, skipping and not skipping function
calls respectively.

<h2>Examining Data</h2>

<p>So once you've stopped at a particular location, you're going to watch to
examine things. The easiest way to do this is with the <i>print</i> command. 
<i>print expr</i> prints the value of expression expr.

<p>The '<i>x</i>' command is the way to go if you need to explicitly tell gdb
the type of data you are working with. For example, you can get a disassembly
of 10 instructions at any particular address by saying <i>x/10i 0xaddr</i>.

<h2>Altering Execution</h2>

<p>The simplest way to alter execution is to change the value of a variable.
This can be accomplished within any expression, for example <i>print x=4</i>
will change the value of x to 4. However, this is a bit of a hack. The proper
way to do it is with the '<i>set var</i>' command.

<p>Believe it or not, you can also call aribtrary functions with the
<i>call</i> command.

<p>Of lesser importance is the ability to <i>jump</i>, <i>return</i>, and
deliver a <i>signal</i> to the current process.

<!--
<h2>Writing Macros</h2>

<p>You can write macros in gdb as well, 


<h2>Threads and forking</h2>

-->

<h2>Special Topics</h2>

<p>You can attach to an existing process with the '<i>attach</i>' command, and
detatch with the <i>detatch</i> command.

<p>You can (barely) debug a running kernel with <i>gdb /usr/src/linux/vmlinux
/proc/kcore</i>. Usually you will have only limited access to symbols (esp in
kernel 2.6), and will obviously be unable to set breakpoints. You cannot
modify memory.

<!--
<p>Now for some fun, how about a sample ret-to-libc exploit? 
-->
<p>For much more info, see the 
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb_toc.html">gdb
manual</a>. It's actually pretty good. Much better than this little writeup 
if you want any detailed info.
