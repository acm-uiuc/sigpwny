The most basic answer is: using the <b>printf()</b> function


However, there are a whole family of functions that use format strings, and
are canidates for exploitation:

     * fprintf - prints to a FILE stream

     * printf - prints to the `stdout' stream

     * sprintf - prints into a string

     * snprintf - prints into a string with length checking

     * vfprintf - print to a FILE stream from a va arg structure

     * vprintf - prints to `stdout' from a va arg structure

     * vsprintf - prints to a string from a va arg structure

     * vsnprintf - prints to a string with length checking from a va arg
       structure

     Relatives:

     * setproctitle - set argv[]

     * syslog - output to the syslog facility

     * others like err*, verr*, warn*, vwarn*
