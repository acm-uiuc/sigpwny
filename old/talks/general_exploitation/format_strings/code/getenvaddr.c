/*
 *  Use this code to get the address of an environment variable
 *  It is important to note that the address will change depending
 *  on the length of the executatable
 *
 *  EXAMPLE:
 *
 *  ./b.out PATH
 *  PATH is located at 0xbfa55b7c
 *
 *
 *  ./b.out2 PATH
 *  PATH is located at 0xbfcfbb7a
 *
 *
 *  ./b.out23 PATH
 *  PATH is located at 0xbff05b78
 *
 *  Notice that for every character difference in the name, the location
 *  of PATH changes by 2 bytes.  Keep this in mind when trying to find
 *  the address of an env. variable in your target program....
