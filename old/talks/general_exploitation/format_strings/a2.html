Like just about everything in C, it's up to the programmer not to do stupid
things.  If you supply more arguments than you actually use, no big deal...
all you end up doing is wasting space on the stack.  On the other hand, if you
supply more format strings than you have arguments, C doesn't can't tell
you've made a mistake, it just looks at the memory where the arguments
*should* be....
