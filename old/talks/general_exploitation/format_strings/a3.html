%n only increments.. there is no way to print 205 bytes then magically print
-34 bytes before calling the second %n.  But we don't need to, we just care
about the lowest 2 bytes.


We can continue to add to 205 (0xcd) until we reach 427 (0x1ab), the extra
0x01 will be overwritten by the next call %n so we don't have to worry about
it.


                cd 00 00 00          |  0x080496dc
                   ab 01 00 00       |  0x080496dd
                      00 00 00 00    |  0x080496de
                         00 00 00 00 |  0x080496df
               ----------------------|
                cd ab 01 00          |  Result starting at 0x080496dc

              After re-writing this in the correct byte order: 0x0001abcd
