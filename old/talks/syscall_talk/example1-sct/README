This example is meant to show you how to find the syscall table in the 2.6
kernel.   

To compile type:
	make

To run type: 
	insmod example1.ko

To stop type:
	rmmod example1

If you're running this on something like an xterm instead of the console, you
may need to run demsg to see the output.  For fun, you can run the command:

grep sys_call_table /boot/System.map

to see that the address from above actually matches.  (use the correct path to
your specific System.map)
