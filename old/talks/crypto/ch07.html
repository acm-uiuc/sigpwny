      Ron Rivest at RSA security (he's the R) in 1987, and it was kept
      as a trade secret until 1994, when it was posted anonymously to
      the cypherpunks mailing list. <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/my-posts/my-rc4-weak-keys" target="_top">Two</a>

      within a year. </p><p>RC4 is a stream cipher. This means it essentially
      functions as a random number generator whose output is XOR'ed
      against the plain-text stream.</p><p>The difference between using a well-designed stream cipher
      as opposed to rand() is that rand() is <a href="http://fscked.org/proj/minihax/randAnalysis" target="_top">predictable</a> in that rand() reveals its
      internal state directly in the output stream. This makes rand()
      vulnerable to known plain-text attacks.  Well designed stream
      ciphers go through great pains to not give away internal state
      when they generate output.  RC4 is reasonably good at this. While
      <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/524295.html" target="_top">there are attacks</a> that can
      reconstruct the internal RC4 state from known-output, they are
      still do not have run-times that make them feasible in practice.
      (Something on the order of 2^800).</p><p>RC4 is still in production use, most notably in SSL and
      802.11 WEP.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2939420"></a>Implementation: The RC4 Algorithm</h2></div></div><div></div></div><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">

      initializes the state table to be a "random" permutation based
      on the key, and the PRGA, which actually returns a random byte.
      Notice how the PRGA does not return an easily determined index
      of the state table.</p><p>RC4 has two parameters: Key size and word size. The word
      size is almost always 8 bits, and the key size varies from 40
      bits to 2<sup>word size</sup>.</p><p>The internal state table S is always 2<sup>word
      size</sup> long. S is a permutation table, which means
      that it contains exactly one of each number from
      0...2<sup>word size</sup>-1.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2956551"></a>The Attacks</h2></div></div><div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2956557"></a>Arthur Roos</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>The first weakness in RC4 was found by <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=43vf2e%24sr8%40net.auckland.ac.nz&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;output=gplain" target="_top"> Arthur Roos</a>, who noted that the key
  scheduling algorithm of RC4 didn't exactly yield a perfectly random
  distribution over the state table.</p><p>His analysis hinged on two key observations:
  </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>It is highly likely that in the initial iterations of the
       KSA, S[i] = i</p></li><li><p>It is relatively likely that once an index has been
      swapped by i, it will not be swapped again. The probability that
      an index is chosen "at random" by j is 1/256, so the probability
      that it won't be chosen is 255/256. So thus, the the probability
      that it won't be chosen every again during the KSA is
      (255/256)^255 (since if i = j, nothing happens), or 37%.</p></li></ol></div><p>

  </p><p>Given these two observations, it is then evident that
  immediately after the KSA runs, the most likely element in S[i] is
  Sum(K[i], O, i) + (i+1)/2, with probability (determined empirically
  and by <a href="http://fscked.org/proj/minihax/WirelessSec/arc4/" target="_top">computation</a>):

        </p><p>He goes on to show that this yields a class of weak keys:

        </p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"> C.   Given an RC4 key K[0]..K[N] with K[0] + K[1]
        == 0 (mod 256), there is a significant probability that the
        first byte generated by RC4 will be K[2] + 3 (mod 256).
        </blockquote></div><p>
        
        </p><p>As a result, if you use RC4, it is highly recommended
        you discard the first several thousand outputs from the PRGA
        to get the state table into a more even distribution.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2956876"></a>Attacks against WEP</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your point of
      view), WEP does not discard the first outputs. Worse, the 802.11
      protocol has several known bytes of plain-text in its LLC
      headers. Worse *still*, WEP resets RC4 for *each packet*. Worse
      *STILL* WEP prepends the RC4 key with an "Initialization
      Vector" that is transmitted in plain text.</p><p>As you might imagine, this is bad.</p><p><a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/fluhrer01weaknesses.html" target="_top">Fluhrer,
      Mantin, and Shamir</a> were the first to take advantage of
      this badness.  Essentially, what they did was realize that if
      you have knowledge of the IV, and the IV is of a certain class
      (the most common is [B+3, 255, X]), then the most likely output
      is S<sub>B+2</sub>[j<sub>B+2</sub> +
      K[B] + S<sub>B+2</sub>[B+3]] with 0.05 probability.
      Since this is &gt; the expected 1/256, after you accumulate a
      sufficient number of weak IV's, you are able to employ a simple
      voting mechanism to pick the most likely value you have, and
      then perform some manipulations to find the Bth key byte. (K[B]
      =
      S<sub>B+2</sub><sup>-1</sup>[output]
      - j<sub>B+2</sub> -
      S<sub>B+2</sub>[B+3])

      </p><p>This process begins with key byte 0, and is repeated,
      using the IV + key bytes 0..B-1 to find key byte B.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch06.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch08.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 6. Skipjack </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 8. MD5</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
