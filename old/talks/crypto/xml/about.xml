    <title>Abstract</title>
    <para>This document should provide readers with a general
    introduction to cryptography. The first section is provided more
    as a basis for the rest and a historical perspective. The
    mathematics required to understand the algorithms is not very
    complex, but when analyzing and deconstructing algorithms, a much
    higher level of knowledge is required. Basic mathematics will be
    provided in the first chapter. If you have suggestions, comments, 
    or corrections, please email me!
    
    <para>This document is a work in progress. Don't expect everything
    to be perfect, or necessarily right. I try to make everything
    correct, but sometimes even I'm wrong.</para>
