    <para>Skipjack was a NSA classified algorithm until 1998, when it
    was made public. It was invented sometime around 1993 and used in
    some public hardware applications such as the clipper chip
    (telephone data encryption) and Fortezza card (PC card). Both
    hardware implementations were available to the public for
    purchase, and were made using taper resistant hardware.</para>
