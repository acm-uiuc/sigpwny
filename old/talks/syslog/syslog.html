<title>SIGMil Forensics Evasion Techniques</title>

<center><h2>Forensics Evasion</h2></center>

<h2>UNIX (Linux-centric)</h2>

<p>So this talk will focus primarily on removing traces of your presence on a
system from the system logs. Most of this talk discusses techniques that only
apply if you have root access to the system, though there are a couple of
hacks available to cover your tracks even after a failed attempt to gain root.

<h3>Cleaning Syslog Entries</h3>

<p>So the first place an attacker needs to turn to attempt to hide their
tracks are the event logs. Event logging on UNIX takes place through the
syslog daemon, and the log messages are all plain text. The configuration file
/etc/syslog.conf describes what files get logged to.

*.info,mail.none                                /var/log/syslog

<p>So what can you use to clean these logs? Well, they're text, aren't they?
grep should work just fine. A few key things to grep for are your IP address,
your username, root, your hostname, services you exploited, etc.

<p>There is one catch though, if you modify a running syslog log file, some
versions of syslog will behave strangely, especially if you replace a file
rather than overwrite it. Some syslog versions have even been known to
complain if the end of file position changes while they are in operation. This
is not the case for Fedora's syslogd (sysklogd-1.4.1-13), however.


<hr>
<pre>
<code>
[killall -9 syslogd]
grep -v username messages > messages.old
grep -v restart messages.old > messages
[and/or edit by hand]
[/etc/init.d/syslogd start]
</code>
</pre>
<p>The right way to replace logs.

<pre>
<code>
grep -v username messages > messages
</code>
</pre>
<p>One of the many wrong ways to replace logs.

<p>The key thing you need to be aware of though, is logging to remote machines
(@hostname) and logging to ttys (/dev/ttyN). Those logs are considerably harder
to clean. 

<p>So what do you do if there are logs off site? Or if you don't have root? 
Well, luckily I have <a href="utils/sysfog-local.c">just the thing</a> for you. This
little utility has the ability to generate fictitious logs from any
process/pid (even nonexistent ones). Best of all, it doesn't require root
privs to run. 

<hr>
<pre>
<code>
Usage ./sysfog [<options>] "process[pid]" "message"

Where options are:
        Log type options:
          -p    Log to AUTHPRIV    -d   Log to DAEMON
          -m    Log to MAIL        -u   Log to NEWS
          -c    Log to CRON        -l   Log to LPR
          -s    Log to SYSLOG      -k   Log to KERNEL
        Log Priority options:
          -e    Error message      -w   Warning Message
          -n    Notice message     -i   Info Message
        Other options:
          -f n  Fill with 'n' messages (ie to fill /var)
          -r n  Generate a 'n' byte message of random crap
          -R n  Randomize the process too
          -L    Randomize Log file

Note that process[pid] doesn't have to be a real process and pid, but should
be believable. It might do you good to have <process> be the name of this
executable as well...

<h3>Cleaning wtmp, utmp, and lastlog</h3>

<p>Ok, but what about the logs that maintain information used by '<i>w</i>',
'<i>last</i>', and '<i>lastlog</i>'? Unfortunately, those are binary logs, and
thus cannot be modified by grep. Luckily tools that edit these logs are quite
prolific.

<p>So the format for the utmp (typically /var/run/utmp) and wtmp (typically
/var/log/wtmp) files are essentially the same, and both can be viewed with the
last command. wtmp contains the entire login history of the machine, and utmp
contains all ids currently logged in.  <a href="utils/xtmp.c">This program</a>
will make short work of both of them.

<p>Alternately, if you do not have root, oftentimes screen will be compiled
with utmp editing capabilities. For example, simply doing command-L will make
that window disappear from the utmp. Do this for all of your screen windows
and you are now invisible. wtmp will still log you, however.

<p>Lastlog (/var/log/lastlog) is a bit trickier. It is basically an array of
entries containing the date, time, tty and hostname of a logged in user. <a
href="utils/lastlogin.c">This editor</a> will take care of that.


<h3>Cleaning shell history</h3>

<p>As has been pointed out in previous lectures, this is an easy one to look
over, but a simple one to fix. Before logging out, just issue a '<i>history
-c</i>'. In a pinch, erase .bash_history as well if you forgot before logging
out once.


<h3>Other log files to watch for</h3>

<p>Some daemons (like apache and exim) don't use syslog. You probably should
poke around /var/log, /var/adm, and /var/run for suspicious looking file.

<p>Some UNIX machines also log commands in the '<i>lastcomm</i>' service,
though this generates so much data that it is usually off. Run <i>lastcomm</i> 
just to be sure.

<p>Also, last but not least, if you are in an extreme hurry, note that copying
a backup of a log (logfile.1) to the current log often works quite nicely ;)
